I neglected my health until I quit my job, putting my health in pretty bad shape. Being chronically tired because of the suboptimal liver condition, which is the result of being overweight, was one of the (in)direct factors that made me quit my job.

That's why the first thing I started right after quitting my job was diet control and exercise. Since I was damn sure that I wouldn't go to the gym because leaving home requires immense determination, I looked for something I could do at home: adjustable-weight dumbbells (I actually bought one before quitting my job), which went perfectly well for me.

I just followed the exercises listed in the pamphlet with the dumbbells. Since I could adjust the weight of the dumbbell, I tried to increase it as much as possible, up to the point where I could barely lift it while doing those exercises. I started my day doing 10 reps of each, which increased some of my muscle mass.

The doctors were right; being lean and muscular makes you healthy. I felt it firsthand after some months of doing the exercise and diet control. Fat shaming is an issue, but weight loss had significantly positive effects on my health because I had a medical condition because of being overweight. I'll never binge on junk food to cope with the stress, doc.

Here, I log the exercises I do and the corresponding weight limit for myself. This sort of logging was something I really wanted when I built this blog anyway.


| Exercise | Weight |
| ---- | ---- |
| Deadlifts | 29×2 kg |
| Lunge | 29×2 kg |
| Squat| 25×2 kg |
| Curl | 18 kg |
| Press | 18 kg |
| Kickback | 15 kg |
| Front Raise | 13 kg |
| Side Lateral Raise | 9 kg |

I recently increased the weight limit on my dumbbells from 24kg to 40kg. This makes me appropriately suffer when I do deadlifts, which were easy before...
