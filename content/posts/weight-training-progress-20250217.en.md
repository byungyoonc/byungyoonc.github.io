It's been a while since I bought a new set of dumbbells. I bought more things to help me exercise and raised the weight I lift.

I bought some mats to suppress the noise I make when I unload my weight to the ground. Releasing such a heavy weight without making noise was nearly impossible, which greatly helped me. I also bought straps after I almost lost my grip during the training.

Straps didn't make a surprising difference to the weight I could lift from the start. They did help stabilize the workout movement, though, making the workout much safer.

Here are the current weights I use:

| Exercise | Weight |
| ---- | ---- |
| Deadlifts | 40×2 kg |
| Lunge | 36×2 kg |
| Squat| 25×2 kg |
| Curl | 25 kg |
| Press | 20 kg |
| Kickback | 18 kg |
| Front Raise | 13 kg |
| Side Lateral Raise | 9 kg |

I just realized I skip from kickback and forth during my workout nowadays. Gotta stay focused, I guess...
