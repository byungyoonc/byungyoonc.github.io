I've been unemployed for nearly a year since I left the company in April 2024, where I've worked for almost seven years.

I've been through many things around me, alongside some I've been doing for myself. I made a significant recovery in my mental health through cognitive therapy, and I made another considerable recovery in my physical health by healthy diet and weight lifts, for example.
The thing is, I never made any concrete log of those activities. That made my memory fade, sometimes resulting in repeating the same mistake over and over.

I've been using my Twitter account for microblogging and archiving crumbs of my thoughts and status. I literally wrote everything back then, so every time I wanted to know what I'd been through, all I had to do was look inside the past tweets I made there.
However, after several years, I found myself writing (or skipping) tweets centered around how others would read instead of jotting down everything I wanted to log. It could be the age I gained along the way; I don't know, but that was happening, and it hindered me from logging what I wanted to write. I didn't like it.

That's one of the reasons I built my blog: to log and archive the things that happened, things I got through, and things I've been thinking of in a relatively longer format.
I'll use this place to organize and archive my thoughts only for my future self. Even if I never read back what I wrote, writing it down in a relatively long form has some value in making me think more about it.

That's the reason why I named this blog Rumination.

I love games. Maybe too much that I made some.
There is a nice loop to being good at games. First, record the play results explicitly or implicitly, then learn from your past mistakes and make incremental improvements throughout repeated runs. I recently found this method very efficient and effective while playing the games myself, and I could apply the same methodology to other acts in my life. It seems obvious, but it was way more engaging when I had a moment of inspiration. It could serve as a big internalized motivation.

That's also one of the motivations that made me start blogging. I'm looking forward to making incremental improvements in my thinking and life by writing down what I have been thinking and doing in a rather detailed fashion.

Another motivation comes from recording the progress of making something.

I love making something new. I successfully finished some of the projects, making something by myself, but I never wrote or recorded anything about the progress anywhere. I regret not doing so.
Better late than never, though. I'm going to record the progress of projects that I'm doing right now or going forward, even things I've done in the past. The primary reason would be to be proud of myself for making something I believe valuable, but it could also help someone else doing similar things.

As someone who has a high mental hurdle to jump over to start something new, it's often very stressful to do nothing but plan for the future. It takes a toll on me when those plans pile on, living in my brain rent-free.
Writing down the chopped-down version of those plans could alleviate that problem, finally doing something about what I wanted to do. It reminds me of those business records I had to make while working. I had no idea back then that would help me now.

Anyhoo, I've finally built my blog after a lengthy planning process. That would remove one of my burdens in my brain: having an unfinished project for such a long time. What a relief. In the future, I plan to share more about my personal development journey and the insights I've gathered along the way. I have no idea if I could continue blogging for a long time, but I'll do my best. Peace!
